Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme,17/06/2024,17/06/2024,17/06/2024,186,Home Office,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,N/A,Partially compliant,2.2,"We are aware of and working to address the following issues. We will update this statement with timelines about when we will resolve them a month after this statement’s publication date.
On several pages, the initial cursor focus is incorrect when the page loads. This means that when navigating with a keyboard, users will not be able to set their focus to the ‘Skip to main content’ link as the first page element. This does not meet WCAG 2.4.3 – Focus Order.
On signing in pages, an error message summary link does not navigate to the correct input field. When users select continue without entering a date of birth, this triggers an error. In the error summary, the relevant hyperlinked message (‘Enter your date of birth’) does not set focus to the date of birth field when selected. Users must therefore manually navigate to the date of birth input field to resolve the error. This does not meet WCAG 3.3.3 – Error Suggestions.
On the enter an email address page, an input field does not have matching visual and accessible labels. Visually, the email address input field is ‘Enter an email address’. However, the visually hidden label is ‘fields.user-email.label’. This makes it difficult to set focus to this field for users of voice control software. This does not meet WCAG 2.5.3 – Label in Name.
On the information you have given us and check your referral pages, the other family information list contains a heading. This is not correct list structure and does not meet WCAG 1.3.1b – Info and Relationships – Lists.
On several pages, the details of listed family members are coded as data tables instead of lists in the HTML. This means users of screen readers may expect column headings to be read out when there are none in the listed details. This does not meet WCAG 1.3.1b – Information and Relationships – Lists.
On the immigration adviser details page, there are two H1 heading tags. This may make the page confusing to navigate for users of screen readers. This does not meet WCAG 2.4.6 – Headings and Labels.
The session timeout of 30 minutes cannot be changed and the user is not alerted when it is running out. This is for each individual page of the form, not the form overall. This does not meet WCAG2.2 – Enough Time.
If you find an issue that we have yet to identify, please contact us using one of the routes described in the ‘Reporting accessibility problems with this website’ section of this statement.

Electronic Travel Authorisation,19/10/2023,19/10/2023,19/10/2023,428,Home Office,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,N/A,Partially compliant,2.2,"We are aware of the following issues. All of these issues will be resolved within several days of this statement's publication date.
The following questions require screen readers to navigate away from radio buttons to announce the questions:

Is your question about an ETA application that has been submitted?
How did you apply for your ETA?

The ""What is your question about"" pages contain multiple H1 heading tags.
The form does not make it clear to all users when a time out is about to occur.
The cursor focus does not correctly align to some error messages when a message is generated. The cursor aligns further down the page when the error message is at the top of the page.
The session timeout of 20 minutes cannot be changed and the user is not alerted when it is running out. This for each individual page of the form, not the form overall. This does not meet WCAG 2.2 Enough Time.
