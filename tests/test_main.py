"""
This file is to run sample csv files and confirm expected outputs. For example:

def test_csv1(input_path):
where input_path points to a csv file in the tests/data directory. One can assert against the output.

multiple csv files can be tested, with varying types of clean and unclean data to test the robustness of the programme
